v1.7: 01FEB2010
	Added CentOS init.d script (Andre Krajnik).

	Fixed default ssl address inconsistancy, now
	defaults to "localhost:443" and fixed documentation
	accordingly (pointed by Markus Schalke).

	Children no longer bind to the listen socket, so
	parent server can be stopped without killing an
	active child (pointed by Matthias Buecher).

	Inetd support (Dima Barsky).

v1.6: 25APR2009
	Added -V, version option.

	Install target directory configurable in Makefile

	Changed syslog prefix in auth.log to "sslh[%pid]"

	Man page

	new 'make install' and 'make install-debian' targets

	PID file now specified using -P command line option

	Actually fixed zombie generation (the v1.5 patch got
	lost, doh!)


v1.5: 10DEC2008
	Fixed zombie generation.

	Added support scripts (), Makefile.

	Changed all 'connexions' to 'connections' to please
	pesky users. Damn users.

v1.4: 13JUL2008
	Added libwrap support for ssh service (Christian Weinberger)
	Only SSH is libwraped, not SSL.

v1.3: 14MAY2008
	Added parsing for local interface to listen on

	Changed default SSL connection to port 442 (443 doesn't make
	sense as a default as we're already listening on 443)

	Syslog incoming connections

v1.2: 12MAY2008
	Fixed compilation warning for AMD64 (Thx Daniel Lange)

v1.1: 21MAY2007
	Making sslhc more like a real daemon:
	* If $PIDFILE is defined, write first PID to it upon startup
	* Fork at startup (detach from terminal)
	(thanks to http://www.enderunix.org/docs/eng/daemon.php -- good checklist)
	* Less memory usage (?)

v1.0: 
	Basic functionality: privilege dropping, target hostnames and ports
	configurable.
